Tests
=====

Core functionality is backed by tests. The ``Aiopyramid`` requires `pytest`_. To run the
tests, grab the code on `github`_, install `pytest`_, and run it like so:

::

    git clone https://github.com/housleyjk/aiopyramid
    cd aiopyramid
    pip install pytest
    py.test

.. _pytest: http://pytest.org
.. _github: https://github.com/housleyjk/aiopyramid
